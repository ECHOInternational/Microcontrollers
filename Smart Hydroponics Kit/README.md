# Overview

The project is an application of the **nutrient film technique** - a type of hydroponics - on a personalized smart farming kit that could be used at home. The tool circulates water (with nutrients) for 70 seconds every 30-second interval, measures and displays environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity, CO2 level), and adjusts the fan based on the CO2 concentration in the air. 

Here's why you should use this tool:
* Place for **4 plants.**
* **Optimized** water use. 
* Displays **temperature, humidity, and CO2 level.** 
* **CO2 level control** using fan.

<!-- Purpose of the Build -->
# Purpose

The purpose of this tool is to optimize water usage in a smart farm kit leveraging NFT (Nutrient Film Technique). From an early age, I have been deeply invested in the issue of food security and water scarcity, especially because my grandparents were farmers, and I knew the plights of local farmers well. In an effort to contribute to addressing these challenges, I decided to explore smart farming. The initial prototype, developed at my school's maker space, had simple features. The code triggered a water pump every 5 minutes for 7 seconds. In a recent upgrade, the kit circulated nutrient-rich water continuously through a pipe for 70 seconds every 30-second interval, and the LCD displayed comprehensive data collected through additional sensors.
