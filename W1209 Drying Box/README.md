# Introduction
This is an inexpensive approach to temperature-controlled drying, with air circulation, in an enclosed space. This drying box was initially developed to dry moringa leaves for making moringa leaf powder. It works well for that purpose, enabling the drying of leaves at a desired temperature (e.g., between 35 and 50 degrees C) for the prevention of mold and minimization of heat-sensitive vitamin loss. The box is a good option for drying small quantities of leaves or seeds.The desired drying temperature can be set with push buttons on the temperature controller, so there is no need to upload programming code via a computer.

# How it works
The drying box is pictured below with its various components. Heat is generated with mini heat pads. Air circulation is provided with axial-style DC computer fans. When connected to power (via a DC adaptor) the fans and heat pads turn on. When the temperature reaches the desired/preset temperature, the heat pads shut off while the fans continue to run. When the temperature drops below the desired temperature, the fans turn on again. Thus, during drying the fans stay on constantly while the heat pads are switched on and off automatically to keep the temperature to within a few degrees of the desired temperature.

Air enters thruogh a small air intake port behind a fan on each side of the box. Just below each fan is a mini heat pad. Thus, incoming air is quickly heated and circulated via the fans within the box. Heated air and water vapor from moisture in the leaves or seeds is vented out the top. 

# Materials
1. An insulated box, such as the Styrofoam cooler pictured above.
2. W1209 temperature controller or something similar. Both 5 and 12 volt options are available. The dryer shown above uses 12 volts. A [W1209 controller](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805851910105.html?src=google&src=google&albch=shopping&acnt=708-803-3821&slnk=&plac=&mtctp=&albbt=Google_7_shopping&gclsrc=aw.ds&albagn=888888&isSmbAutoCall=false&needSmbHouyi=false&src=google&albch=shopping&acnt=708-803-3821&slnk=&plac=&mtctp=&albbt=Google_7_shopping&gclsrc=aw.ds&albagn=888888&ds_e_adid=&ds_e_matchtype=&ds_e_device=c&ds_e_network=x&ds_e_product_group_id=&ds_e_product_id=en3256805851910105&ds_e_product_merchant_id=109144340&ds_e_product_country=US&ds_e_product_language=en&ds_e_product_channel=online&ds_e_product_store_id=&ds_url_v=2&albcp=19623912707&albag=&isSmbAutoCall=false&needSmbHouyi=false&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwmYCzBhA6EiwAxFwfgEj1_OyVOn2Clk6kr6kFfY08jwdATWD7-ReEFJdhNmse2NiaI06uTRoCcZAQAvD_BwE&aff_fcid=e80e6b8574cd4b178f86be2d633626d3-1717620333549-01390-UneMJZVf&aff_fsk=UneMJZVf&aff_platform=aaf&sk=UneMJZVf&aff_trace_key=e80e6b8574cd4b178f86be2d633626d3-1717620333549-01390-UneMJZVf&terminal_id=14bb5c891ddb4baebb0909fb32ee2f45&afSmartRedirect=y&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa) can be purchased for a dollar or two plus a few dollars for shipping.
3. Two 12-volt mini heat pads
4. Wires (e.g. 22 awg thickness for connecting components) and connectors (twist connecters or screw terminals depending on your design preference)
5. Two 12-volt DC computer fans
6. A 12-volt DC power adapter (the one used for this dryer is rated for a current draw of 5 amps, to make sure it can power the heat pads and fans adequately, but you may be able to generate sufficient heat with less current). The adaptor used for this dryer came with a barrel jack screw terminal for easy connection of the W1209 power and ground wires to the DC power adapter.
7. Two short pieces of narrow-diameter PVC pipe for the vent.
8. Two short pieces of drip irrigation feeder tubing (or something similar), one for each of the air intake ports.
